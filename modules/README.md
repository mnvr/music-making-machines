## 8vert

8vert outputs 10V,

![8vert outputs 10V](i/8vert10v-1.png)

As many times as you want.

![8vert has multiple outputs](i/8vert10v-2.png)

Not just 10V, but anything you want.

![8vert copies its first input](i/8vert10v-3.png)

As much of it as you want,

![8vert allows attenuating its inputs](i/8vert10v-4.png)

Phase shifted if you want.

Of many kinds if you want.

![8vert restarts the ladder on each input](i/8vert10v-6.png)

8vert can output any volts, not 10 if you want.

![8vert allows arbitrary constant voltage outputs](i/8vert10v-7.png)

8 attenuverters make 8vert, making this the 8th fact about it, and let's move
on.

## Oct

Oct outputs 1V.

But it can also output 4.
